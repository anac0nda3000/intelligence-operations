It translates general threat intelligence into specific, actionable steps. The focus is on identifying and responding to the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) of threat actors, often using frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK. The following are the high level steps to create a playbook for a adversarial behavior investigation.

Preparation
- Ensure necessary tools, logs, and procedures are in place
- Ingest the latest TTPs and IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) from intelligence feeds and map them to existing detection coverage

Identification
- Detect and confirm suspicious activity
- Use behavioral indicators to spot activity that deviates from a known "normal" baseline

Containment/Analysis
- Limit the spread and scope of the threat
- Conduct a deeper analysis to understand the full attack chain
- Provide context on the threat actor's motivations and historical behavior to guide the investigation

Remediation
- Remove the threat and return systems to a normal operating state
- Inform specific actions needed on systems to ensure the malicious activity is fully eradicated
